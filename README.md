# SSH Tunnel Builder

This app allows you to create and manage SSH tunnels connections to remote systems. Connections to the remote servers are encrypted using standard SSH encryption, the same that allows secure terminal access to remote servers running Linux, macOS, or Windows. This allows for an easy-to-setup alternative to a VPN.

Connection definitions are stored in iCloud, allowing for easy transfer of connection definitions between systems running the software from the same AppleID account. It is also possible to export and import connection definitions for easy sharing with other users.

This software uses the Apple Swift-NIO and Swift-NIO-SSH libraries for all of the SSH specific implementation. 

The software has been tested and found to be functional on MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) and MacOS 11.x (Big Sur). Support for MacOS 12.x (Monteray) is planned as soon as it is released. Other versions of Mac OS may or may not work as they have not been tested and no assumption is made in this regard. Your mileage may vary. The App Store version is only available on Catalina or newer.

## Export Rules

SSH Tunnel Builder can be sold to customers worldwide under the unrestricted status provisions of the "ENC" export license exemption. Under ENC rules, export licenses are not required. The export control classification number (ECCN) is 5D002.

Unrestricted export status allows SSH Tunnel Builder export to individuals, companies, and foreign government users, with an export check for denied parties. Export is not allowed to countries of group E:1 where commerce is prohibited under U.S. trade sanctions (Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan).

These rules apply to users purchasing the software from the Mac App Store or accessing the source code on GitHub, as both Apple and GitHub are U.S companies subject to U.S. trade regulations.
